In my mind, an add-on module would be made from left over parts from the proton pack. The neutrona wand main body is perfect so i used that as a base. There's three led part and one for bargraph. You can add two toggle switch or change one of them as push button like i do. For me, the knob is used to controll amp volume by relocating the volume knob from your audio amplifier. 

Use your creativity on how to light them up. Feel free to add your own greebles !

IMPORTANT NOTE :
* Download the files and you have to print them yourself.
* There's no assembly or electronic guide  
* Lens required to be printed with resin printer due to it's small size. Clear resin with dye added is recommended.
* Assembly is very straight forward. The bottom cover uses 4pcs of M3 screw and 4pcs of M3 brass heatset. Other screws are purely decoration and just need to be glued in.
* All files included in the zip file is for single person and strictly for personal usage only. Feel free to share but do not sell them.

Parts Needed :
1. Button M3 X 8 (12pcs)
2. M3 X 5 X 6 brass heatset (4pcs)
2. Toggle switch (6.2mm hole)
3. Pushbutton (6.8mm hole)
4. GX16 connector (5 pin) 
--> 2pins for power from the pack
--> 3pins for volume knob from amp
--> Pick extra pins if you planning to controll other things with the switches

3D PRINTING SETTINGS:
Resin printing required for all the lens. Clear resin with dye added is recommended.


Electronics:
There's to electronic guide at the moment. This was design to use 8bit WS2812B led bar as the bargraph and normal 5mm led for the rest of the leds. The knob is meant for controlling volume from the proton pack amp. Hence the GX16 connector . This will be the connector to the proton pack for power and amp volume knob wires.
